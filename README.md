# Welcome to [The Dali Club](https://moneyheistmaskcom.netlify.app/mini-project/)!!


What does it mean to own a piece of the internet? Can you sell a meme to the highest bidder? Is the metaverse finally happening? Let's find out together!

Welcome to The Dali Club, a collective of web developers and technology enthusiasts here to figure out what's going on with non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. In the past few years, NFTs have gone from a niche concern within the blockchain world to a cultural phenomenon that has captured the imagination of artists, technologists, and the mass media.

As builders, we'll be exploring NFTs from the technical side, taking them apart, and seeing how they work. We'll also take a look at some of the use cases for NFTs, so that we can help build new experiences around them.

# Quick Start
The Dali Club is a growing work-in-progress, so check back frequently for new content! To get started right away, try these top items:
1. [NFT Basics](https://github.com/protocol/nft-website/blob/main/docs/concepts/non-fungible-tokens.md) is a high-level overview of just what an NFT is exactly, and what they're being used for.
2. Our [First Steps Tutorial](https://github.com/protocol/nft-website/blob/main/docs/tutorial/first-steps.md) helps you get set up to interact with smart contracts on Ethereum, before we get into the specifics of NFTs themselves.
3. In the [End-to-end Experience Tutorial](https://github.com/protocol/nft-website/blob/main/docs/tutorial/end-to-end-experience.md), we examine a simple NFT minting app to see exactly how the process works â€” from storing images on IPFS to creating tokens on Ethereum.
